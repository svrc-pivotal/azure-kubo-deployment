# Azure kubo-deployment

Kubo is a [BOSH](https://bosh.io/) release for Kubernetes. It provides a solution for deploying and managing Kubernetes with BOSH.  This is a fork for evolving Azure support pending PRs to [kubo-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/pull/223) and [kubo-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/pull/320).  

Note:  Some form of Azure support is expected to be committed to the upstream in Fall of 2018, which may or may not include content from these repositories.  This is an unoffical fork for use by users that wish to pursue and explore CFCR on Azure before the upstream supports it.
